# Lotto Numbers Prediction

This app is designed to provide suggestions for National Lottery Lotto 
 numbers. The app takes data related to past lottery draws, analyzes the numbers that have appeared frequently, and suggests potential numbers for future draws based on patterns or trends in past data.

The app uses various algorithms or statistical methods to determine which numbers are more likely to be drawn in the future. It could offer different types of suggestions, such as global suggestions that consider the overall frequency of numbers across all lottery draws or suggestions specific to each lottery machine.

Users of the app could input or retrieve data related to previous lottery draws, and the app would use that data to generate the suggested numbers. This way, the app aims to assist users in making more informed decisions when choosing their lottery numbers, potentially increasing their chances of winning.
